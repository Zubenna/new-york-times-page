                    <p>
                    CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan 
                    Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his
                     notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                    He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that 
                    should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have 
                    made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course 
                    of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that 
                    exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed 
                    of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look 
                    uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous 
                    ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were 
                    ot missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean. 
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a 
                    double box around it.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen 
                    the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.  
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic 
                    time </a>with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac 
                    of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of 
                    space-time — so-called <a href="#">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a 
                    universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a 
                    trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun 
                    evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was 
                    correct.

                     <p>
                        Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including 
                        Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to 
                        the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang 
                        itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and 
                        speculation.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion 
                        light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an 
                        infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are 
                        unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of 
                        other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
                     </p>
                     <h3>‘As Big as It Gets’</h3>
                     <p>
                        In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies 
                        orever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into 
                        gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of 
                        gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, 
                        should ruffle space-time.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not 
                        part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram 
                        encoded in gravitational waves.” 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave 
                        radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 
                        380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun. 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for 
                        Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a 
                        scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of 
                        papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.
